# Automatic Number Plate Recognition

System for detecting plate numbers of cars from video

## Tools used

- OpenCV
- Pycharm

## Challenges faced

**Challenge:** The challenges faced was about the duration it took to complete the automation process (Thinking that automation means fast work but I didn't count on the length of the work)

**Solution:** No specific solution was in there except to continue optimizing.

## Brief summary of experience

- So tedious and tiresome
- Single error required to restart the process (not that enjoyful)
- But the end result is worth it. So I did struggle but I enjoy the outcome
